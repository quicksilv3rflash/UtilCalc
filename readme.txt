I've gotten in a lot of trouble with this project because it's so tempting to apply my definitions of good to others but it only seems to cause them pain without actually correcting* them.

*correcting = causing them to become aligned with my personal arbitrary views of what it means to do good

Anyway. UtilCalcV1.0 lets you estimate the value of a life in the unit of square thermostat seconds.

If you want to estimate the impact of an event, you just list the duration of the event instead of the duration of the life. Enter truth and happiness values for the duration of the event.

You can use UtilCalcV1.0 to estimate which attempts to generate ethical good are more efficient by my own understanding.

I love you all very much.

It is extremely painful.
